This directory is the center for checking the completion of pathways.
The method for checking pathway completeness would go as follows:
1. Have a list of pathways with each pathway having all the EC numbers listed in order.
2. For each organism, run through the pathways and check if the EC numbers are represented in the organism's
list of total reactions.
3. Print a result where each pathway has a percentage completeness number, and the enzymes missing.
