    <p>The app compares all the reactions in a Model and calculates how many of them are in each of the pathways given by KEGG. It currently only takes FBA Models (after running 'Build Metabolic Model') and Domain Annotation objects after running TIGRFAM Domain Annotation. It will run other versions of Domain Annotation objects (Pfam) but it won't return any valuable information.</p>
